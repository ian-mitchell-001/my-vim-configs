# My vim configs

The `.vimrc` I use for gvim. It's made to support

* C;
* Markdown;
* Python;
* LaTeX. 

So, it should do well for most programmer's needs. 

**NOTE:** IF YOU HAVE THE AUTOLOAD, BUNDLE, AND DOC, DIRECTORIES ON YOUR COMPUTER, DRAG AND DROP THE CONTENTS FROM MINE INTO YOURS.

## TODO

* With my plans on learning haskell (the syntax is too attractive to bear), I'm planning on adding haskell syntax support and a macro for the haskell compiler. 

* Add some better syntax support for C and python.

* Create LaTeX shortcuts
