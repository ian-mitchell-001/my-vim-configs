# CHANGELOG

## April 2018

### April 1, 2018

* Changed the repo license to the unlicense. 
* Changed some grammar in `CHANGELOG.md` (woah, meta!).
* *Happy easter!*

## January 2018

### January 28, 2018

* Added `vim-pandoc` support.
* Updated `README.md` and the `.vimrc` file.
* Copying and pasting is now done with `<CTL> + c` and `<CTL> + p` in visual mode due to some arcane keystroke magic.

## September 2017

### September 21, 2017

* Added a `<CTL> + c` and `<CTL> + v` to the vim config for traditional copying and pasting. Vim's model of copying and pasting is awful.
