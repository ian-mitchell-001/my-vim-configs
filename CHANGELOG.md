# CHANGELOG

## January 2018

### January 28th, 2018

* Added `vim-pandoc` support.
* Updated `README.md` and the `.vimrc` file.
* Copying and pasting is now done with `<CTL> + c` and `<CTL> + p` in visual mode due to some arcane keystroke magic.

## September 2017

### September 21st 2017

* Added a `<CTL> + c` and `<CTL> + v` to the vim config for traditional copying and pasting. Vim's model of copying and pasting is awful.
